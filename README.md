# BeatBond  

**BeatBond** is a web application designed to connect music enthusiasts based on their shared tastes and preferences. The platform allows users to discover new music, engage in discussions, and connect with like-minded individuals, while also integrating with popular streaming platforms for recommendations.

## Objective  

The goal of BeatBond was to create an interactive platform where music becomes a social experience. By combining database-driven backend logic with external APIs (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube), the app could generate personalized recommendations and match users with similar tastes.
